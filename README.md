Point Cloud IO
======================

Overview
---------------

These are two simple [ROS] point cloud helper nodes. **_read_** reads a point cloud from file (ply or vtk) and publishes it as a [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2] message. **_write_** subscribes to a [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2] topic and writes received messages to seperate files (ply, pcd).

For visualization, make sure to set the **Decay Time** in the **PointCloud2** tab in [rviz] to a high number to get the point cloud visible for a long time.

This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

Installation
------------

### Dependencies

This software is built on the Robot Operating System ([ROS]), which needs to be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org) first. Additionaly, the it depends on following software:

- [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/).


### Building

In order to build Point Cloud IO, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd ~/catkin_workspace/src
    git clone https://github.com/anybotics/point_cloud_io.git
    cd ../
    catkin build point_cloud_io

Note: building the tool with support for the VTK file format is disabled by default. To enable it, run `catkin build point_cloud_io --cmake-args -DBUILD_WITH_VTK_SUPPORT=True` instead.

Usage
------------

To create your own launch-file, you can use the examples from `point_cloud_io/launch/...`.


### Read

Load and publish a ply or vtk file with

    rosrun point_cloud_io read _file_path:=/home/user/my_point_cloud.ply _topic:=/my_topic _frame:=/sensor_frame

Optionally, you can also add `_rate:=1.0` to have the node publish your point cloud at the specified rate.


### Write

Subscribe and save point clouds to a ply file with

    rosrun point_cloud_io write _topic:=/your_topic _folder_path:=/home/user/my_point_clouds

Optionally, you can set parameters to fit the point cloud file names to your needs:

- `_file_prefix:=my_prefix` (default: "point_cloud")
- `_file_ending:=my_ending` (default: "ply", currently only format which is supported for writing)
- `_add_counter_to_path:=false` (default: `true`)
- `_add_frame_id_to_path:=true` (default: `false`)
- `_add_stamp_sec_to_path:=true` (default: `false`)
- `_add_stamp_nsec_to_path:=true` (default: `false`)
